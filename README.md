## Median of Medians

## Description
This program implements three different algorithms which solve the find kth element problem and measures their performance based on input vectors of different sizes. These algorthms include brute force, quick select and median of five. The input vectors can be  automatically generated using funtions small(), medium() and large() and range in sizes from 10 to 500 elements. If you would like to add your own test cases, please add them to the main.cpp file. If you would like to test this program, run the main.cpp file and select the algorithm you wish to run.
